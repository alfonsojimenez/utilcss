# Utilitarian CSS Framework

UCSSM is a CSS framework and methodology for developing responsive, mobile first projects on the web. 

Unlike other similar projects such as Bootstrap or BEM, UCSSM focuses on the utilitarian philosophy of CSS: which advocates using atomized classes with individual utility applied to the element instead of creating an initial set of predefined structures, thus increasing the overall size of the CSS file and the time it takes to maintain it or resume the development of it. Websites that are made with UCSSM offer greater overall performance: rendering speed cut in half, smaller size of CSS files.
